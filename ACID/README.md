# A C I D


This function ensures ACID compliance for database transactions.

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability:

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.

- **Isolation**: Ensures that concurrently executing transactions do not affect each other, providing the illusion that transactions are executed serially.

- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

This function is designed to handle transactions in a way that adheres to these principles, providing reliable and predictable database behavior.

## Isolation Levels in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL provides different isolation levels to control the visibility of changes made by concurrent transactions. The isolation levels are:

- **Read Uncommitted**: This level allows a transaction to see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. However, PostgreSQL treats this level as `Read Committed`.

- **Read Committed**: This is the default isolation level in PostgreSQL. A transaction can only see changes that were committed before the transaction began. It cannot see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.

- **Repeatable Read**: This level ensures that if a transaction reads the same data multiple times, it will see the same data each time, even if other transactions are making changes. However, it does not protect against phantom reads.

- **Serializable**: This is the strictest isolation level. It ensures complete isolation from other transactions, providing the illusion that transactions are executed serially. It prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

These isolation levels help in managing the trade-off between data consistency and system performance.
