# Security in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL offers a robust set of security features to ensure the safety and integrity of your data. Below are some key aspects of PostgreSQL security:

## Authentication

PostgreSQL supports various authentication methods, including which can be modified in pg_hba.conf:
- **Password Authentication**: Using md5, scram-sha-256, or plain text passwords. 
- **GSSAPI**: For Kerberos-based authentication.
- **SSPI**: For Windows-based authentication.
- **LDAP**: For directory-based authentication.
- **Certificate Authentication**: Using SSL client certificates.

### PGPASS

Passwordless login by saving password in pgpass

## Authorization

PostgreSQL provides fine-grained access control through roles and privileges:
- **Roles**: Can be users or groups of users.
- **Privileges**: Include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and more, which can be granted on tables, schemas, databases, and other objects.

## Encryption

PostgreSQL supports encryption to protect data:
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypts data in transit between the client and server.
- **Column-Level Encryption**: Using extensions like pgcrypto for encrypting specific columns.
- **Row-Level**: Row Level Security (RLS) has been available since Postgres version 9.5. RLS allows fine-grained access to table rows based on the current user role. This includes SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT operations

## Auditing

PostgreSQL can log various activities for auditing purposes:
- **Logging**: Configurable logging of connections, disconnections, queries, and errors.
- **Extensions**: Such as `pgaudit` for detailed auditing of database activities.

## Best Practices

- Use strong, unique passwords for database roles.
- Regularly update PostgreSQL to the latest version.
- Restrict access to the database server using firewalls and network policies.
- Regularly review and update roles and privileges.
- Enable SSL/TLS for all client-server communications.
